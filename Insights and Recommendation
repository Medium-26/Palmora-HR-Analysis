 Palmora Group HR Analytics – Insight Summary


 Focus Area: Gender Distribution, Ratings, Salary Structure, and Compliance



 1. Gender Distribution Across the Organization

Companywide:

 Female employees make up 49.15% of the workforce
 Male employees represent 46.62%
 Unspecified gender accounts for 4.23%
While gender representation seems fairly balanced overall, a closer breakdown by region and department highlights critical imbalances.
By Region:
Abuja: Shows high female representation, with a relatively fair male presence. Unspecified gender is minimal.
Kaduna: Has a fairly balanced gender distribution, though males have a slight edge.
Lagos: Leans female in number but the distribution is skewed—many women are concentrated in lower pay bands, while male employees dominate higherlevel roles.
By Department:
| Department       | Dominant Gender | Key Notes                                                      |
|  |  |  |
| Sales            | Male            | Gender imbalance with clear male dominance in pay and numbers. |
| Product/Service  | Male            | Noticeable male concentration in higher roles.                 |
| HR & Engineering | Female          | Women dominate in headcount and earnings.                      |
| Marketing        | Neutral         | Balanced gender representation, but male bonuses trend higher. |
| Admin/Support    | Female          | Women dominate but concentrated in lower salary bands.         |

While the overall gender split across Palmora appears balanced — with women slightly outnumbering men — a deeper dive shows unequal representation across departments and regions. For example:

 Sales and Product/Service departments are maledominated, especially at higher pay levels.
 Admin/Support and HR departments are femaleled but concentrated in lower salary bands.
 Unspecified gender data, although minimal, indicates a need to improve employee data collection practices.

Interpretation: Gender equality is more than just headcount. Representation in roles, pay bands, and decisionmaking levels needs attention.



 2. Performance Ratings by Gender

An analysis of employee performance ratings reveals a consistent trend:

 Female employees are more likely to be rated as Average, Good, or Very Good
 Male employees are more frequently found in Poor or Very Poor categories

This suggests that women are not just well represented — they’re also outperforming in evaluations. This could serve as a strong basis for leadership development and promotion strategies focused on female talent. Performance ratings reveal that women are consistently rated higher, especially in Average, Good, and Very Good categories. Men, on the other hand, are more frequently found in the lower performance categories.

Interpretation: This finding presents an opportunity. Palmora should consider advancing female employees into leadership pipelines, management training programs, and highimpact roles.



 3. Salary Structure & Gender Pay Gap

Across the board, the average salary for females stands at \$72,140, while the average for males is \$74,790. Though the pay gap is minimal (roughly 0.04%), it’s worth noting where disparities are more pronounced.

Departments with Notable Gaps:

| Department      | Pay Gap Direction | Recommendation                                    |
|  |  |  |
| Sales           | Favors males      | Requires immediate review of pay structure.       |
| Product/Service | Favors males      | Suggests salary audit and performance evaluation. |
| Marketing       | Neutral salaries  | But bonuses skew toward male employees.           |

Regional Observations:

| Region | Key Insight                                                                      |
|  |  |
| Lagos  | Femaleheavy workforce, but earnings are concentrated in the lower pay brackets. |
| Abuja  | Home to the highest earners and most employees earning above \$90K.              |
| Kaduna | Balanced in gender and pay levels, with relatively fair bonus distribution.      |
The overall average salary gap between men and women is around $2,650, favoring men. However, this varies by department:

In Sales and Product/Service, male employees earn significantly more.

In HR and Engineering, women appear to have a slight advantage.

Bonuses in Marketing seem skewed in favor of male employees, even when base salaries are equal.

Interpretation: While the company isn’t in a crisis situation, the inconsistencies in pay equity should be addressed. Transparency, salary band audits, and structured compensation frameworks can help.



 4. Regulatory Compliance: Minimum \$90,000 Salary Rule

A new regulation mandates a minimum salary of \$90,000 for employees in the manufacturing sector.

Palmora’s Compliance Status:

 Only 292 out of 874 employees (approx. 33.4%) currently earn \$90K or more.
 Therefore, Palmora is not fully compliant and must prioritize reviewing lower salary structures.
A majority fall within the $30K–$60K range, especially in Lagos and Kaduna. Abuja is the only region where most employees are in the compliant bracket.

Interpretation: Noncompliance poses both a reputational and legal risk for Palmora. Management must prioritize salary restructuring, particularly for skilled roles currently earning below this threshold.


 Salary Band Distribution (Grouped by \$10,000)

Here’s how employee salaries are distributed:

| Salary Band     | Observations                                                      |
|  |  |
| <\$30K      | Largely femaledominated; these are entrylevel or support roles. |
| \$30K–\$60K | Contains the highest concentration of staff.                      |
| \$60K–\$90K | Moderate representation across regions.                           |
| >\$90K      | Dominated by male employees in senior or expertlevel positions.  |

By Region:

| Region     | Salary Band Trends                                                       |
|  |  |
| Abuja  | Strongest presence in the \$90K+ band; toppaying region.                |
| Kaduna | Mostly midtier salaries; good balance overall.                          |
| Lagos  | Majority of employees earn below \$70K; pay restructuring may be needed. |


Recommendations
1. Strengthen Gender Equity in Pay and Promotions
While the company appears gender-balanced on the surface, deeper analysis reveals a clustering of female employees in lower salary bands and limited representation in high-paying roles, particularly in Sales and Product departments.
Recommendation:
•	Conduct a thorough pay equity audit across departments.
•	Implement career advancement frameworks targeted at supporting high-performing female employees into leadership roles.
•	Set departmental diversity goals for senior and technical roles.

2. Standardize Performance-Based Bonus Allocation
Bonuses are meant to reward performance, but inconsistencies suggest that similar ratings don’t always lead to proportionate bonuses—particularly in Marketing.
Recommendation:
•	Introduce a transparent, performance-tiered bonus policy.
•	Clearly define bonus brackets aligned with ratings and ensure equal application across departments and gender.

3. Accelerate Compliance with the $90,000 Salary Mandate
With only 33% of staff currently meeting the regulatory salary minimum, the business risks reputational and legal implications if this isn’t addressed swiftly.
Recommendation:
•	Begin phased salary reviews, prioritizing underpaid roles with high output or critical business impact.
•	Pay special attention to Lagos-based teams, where the concentration of sub-$90K earners is highest.

4. Create a Culture of Data Completeness and Accountability
Missing values in gender and departmental data, although few, indicate a gap in data discipline that may hinder future audits and reporting accuracy.
Recommendation:
•	Mandate regular HR record updates and standardize data entry fields.
•	Implement automated checks in HR systems to flag missing or inconsistent entries.

5. Institutionalize Equity-Focused HR Analytics
This analysis revealed trends that would have been difficult to spot without proper data tracking. Building on this momentum can strengthen Palmora’s HR strategy over time.
Recommendation:
•	Introduce quarterly HR analytics reports focused on inclusion, performance, and compensation.
•	Equip team leads with dashboards to make data-informed decisions on staffing, evaluation, and retention.
